- Epilogue -
A meandering soul found way into the
gates of absolution way too early into
it's mission.

Thankfully, there is a plan for every
drop of a river and even the smallest
pebble will help the shoal withstand
the incoming storm.

Do not feel discouraged by whatever
setback in your journey.

Into the dark reigns of DOS for now.
